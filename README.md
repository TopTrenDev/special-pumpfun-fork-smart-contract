# Special ðŸ’Š Pumpfun Smart Contract

The **Special Pumpfun Smart Contract** is a customized version of the popular Pump.fun system â€” but with a twist.  
Instead of using **SOL** as the base token, this contract is built to **operate entirely with a specific SPL token**.  

This enables developers to launch, trade, and interact within ecosystems where SOL isnâ€™t the primary currency.

## ðŸ§± How It Works

Unlike standard Pump.fun contracts that rely on SOL liquidity,  
this version uses an **SPL token account** as the base for all trades and bonding curve logic.

When a token reaches maturity or threshold conditions,  
you can **migrate liquidity directly to Raydium CPMM**, allowing ongoing decentralized trading.
